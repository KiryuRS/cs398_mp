# CS 398 Mini Project
This is a mini project using CUDA programming. This is only for educational purpose and should not be re-distributed.

This project will be based off comparing two version of fractal techniques (i.e. L-System, Random Fractals, IFS, ETF, etc.) based off performance and efficiency.
