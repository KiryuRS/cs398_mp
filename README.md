# CS 398 Mini Project
This is a mini project using CUDA programming. This is only for educational purpose and should not be re-distributed.

This project will be based off comparing two version of fractal techniques (i.e. L-System, Random Fractals, IFS, ETF, etc.) based off performance and efficiency.

Implementation Roles
--------------------
WhyKay92:
- ETF | Mandelbrot
- IFS | Sierpinski Triangle

Kiryu:
- Random Fractals | Self Avoiding Walks
- Random Fractals | Brownian Tree

CJ:
- ETF | Burning Ship Fractal
- L-System | Fractal Tree

Koori:
- Strange Attractors | Classical HÃ©non map
- FSR | Sierpinski carpet / Cantor set
